Electric Vehicle Charging Demand Prediction
This project uses time-series forecasting and deep learning (LSTM) to predict the charging demand for electric vehicles (EVs). By analyzing historical usage data, we aim to model future energy demand, which can be useful for optimizing infrastructure planning and energy resource management.

# Project Structure
# Electric_vehicle.ipynb: Main Jupyter notebook containing all data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation steps.

data.csv (assumed): Input dataset with timestamped EV charging energy consumption.

# Objective
To build a deep learning model that predicts future EV charging demand based on past trends using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

# Tools and Libraries
Python (3.x)

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

MinMaxScaler

# Workflow Overview
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Loaded a CSV file containing timestamped energy usage data.

Performed basic EDA: checked for missing values, inspected column types and distributions.

2. Data Preprocessing
Converted timestamps into datetime format.

Extracted time-based features such as hour, day of week, and month.

Normalized energy values using MinMaxScaler.

3. Feature Engineering
Created supervised learning format using sliding windows:

Input: sequence of past n steps.

Output: energy demand at next time step.

4. Model Building
Built a sequential LSTM model using Keras.

Defined layers: LSTM followed by Dense.

Compiled with mean squared error loss and adam optimizer.

5. Model Training and Evaluation
Trained the model on training data and evaluated it on test data.

Measured performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Plotted predictions versus actual values.

# Results
The model was able to learn temporal patterns in EV charging.

Predictions closely followed the actual energy demand curve.

The approach can be extended to real-world EV station load forecasting.

# Key Learnings
LSTM models are powerful for time-series prediction tasks.

Feature extraction from timestamps improves model performance.

Proper data scaling is essential for training deep learning models.

Visualizing predictions helps with interpretation and debugging.

# Future Work
Hyperparameter tuning (epochs, batch size, LSTM units).

Include external factors like weather or traffic data.

Deploy as a web dashboard or API.

Explore other models like Prophet, GRU, or Transformer-based forecasting.
