# Electric Vehicle Prediction and Analysis â€“ Week 1
# Project Overview
This repository contains the Week 1 submission for the AICTE-Edunet Foundation Internship Program. The project focuses on electric vehicle (EV) data analysis and prediction using Python and machine learning tools. We aim to explore the current EV landscape and derive useful insights to promote sustainable mobility.

 # Files Included
File Name	Description
Electric_vehicle.ipynb	Jupyter Notebook with analysis and visualization scripts.
EV Vehicle Prediction and Analysis dataset.csv	Cleaned dataset used for data exploration and modeling.

# Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook/ Google Colab

#  Week 1 Goals
Upload and clean the dataset
Explore key features
Visualize basic patterns and trends
Identify factors influencing EV cost and performance

# Program Details
This work is a part of the AICTE Virtual Internship Program under the mentorship of Edunet Foundation. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in data science and real-world problem solving.
